                    <p>Well, My name is Hannah and I used to be a teacher.
                    I taught pretty much my entire time in college and a few years after I left university as well.
                I even went to school for biology and Neuroscience with the thought of becoming a teacher. I came to the conclusion
                 that working with kids is a passion of mine, but being a teacher was very unfufilling. <br> I had also begun learning C# and video game development after highschool,
                and mainly did this as a hobby or creative outlet. If you could divide my brain into traits I hold, I would say that creativity would cover about 90% of it</p>

                    <summary><h2>Why Did I choose Software Development?</h2></summary>
                
                    <p>This is a bit convoluted so please fasten your seatbelts as you follow me down the rabbit hole. <br>
                        But I have loved video games since I was a child and always wanted to create my own playable stories. 
                        I began writing plots as a 6 year old and still have them to this day. I actually turned a few of those Ideas into published comics as a teenager, 
                        but ultimately didnt being coding until 2019. I started off slow with just Unity and C# yet I found myself becoming obsessed with it. I was in university and working full time
                        so I didnt really have time to delve deep like I wanted to. <br> I didnt think I was very good either. I pretty much sucked at technology if I am being honest with myself.
                        Then the pandemic hit and gave me pretty much unlimited time in front of my computer screen as I was stuck in the house. <br>
                        It was during this time that I became more confident in my skills and even branched out to different development languages. 
                        I ended up leaving school year three due to multiple factors but it gave me the perfect oppertunity to pursure my goals in software development. 
                        I ended up joining a local coding bootcamp and fell in love with the creative processes of web development.

                    <p>C# will always have a special place in my heart. It was the first language I ever learned and continues to be my strongest, alongside 
                        JavaScript and Python.</p>

                    <p>I loved creating the Static StoreFront Landing Page. <br> It was fun to create and more so cathartic that stressful as an assignment.
                         I love pink and think that making a webpage with all pink was something I dont really see often.
                        Since it was a  perosnal project I could be extremely experimental and try unconventioal artstyles. </p>

                    <p>I adore plants!! I have dozens of them at home and continue to grow that number!! 
                        Seeing them makes me so happy and calms my nerves, so I decided to add some to my portfolio in the hopes that they can make other people smile that they do, me.</p>
